## Description
I was tasked with converting a PSD design to HTML. After extracting the images from the provided file, I followed instructions to ensure the website would be fully responsive. Specifically, when viewed on a mobile screen, the carousel was required to convert into an accordion. To accomplish this, I utilized a responsive carousel snippet from bootsnipp.com and implemented the accordion functionality using Bootstrap.
